# UFOfileZipper 

`tdUFOfileZipper.py`

The script runs after saving the ufo-file and packs it into a zip archive. The previous version of the zip archive is copied with the "back" suffix. In this way, you always have the current saved version of the ufo-file in the zip archive and the second previous copy.

_The script must be set as a startup-script in the Robofont settings._
